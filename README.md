# Venture Travelers — Travel Agency Web App

[view.live.demo] (https://travel-agency-ebon.vercel.app/)

Welcome to Venture Travelers — a small, delightful web application that packages adventure into curated tours, travel planning deals, and unforgettable escapes. Thoughtfully designed for browsers and humans alike, this project showcases beautiful hero imagery, destination cards, and an easy-to-use flow for exploring trips.

I used this to practice styling with bootstrap.

## What it is

Venture Travelers is a static web front-end for a travel agency. It offers:

- An engaging hero section that invites users to explore.
- A curated list of leading destinations with cards and imagery.
- Buttons and anchors that link users to sections for tours and contact.

This repository is a clean, approachable starting point for a travel website or a portfolio piece demonstrating responsive layout and UX-focused design.

## Features

- Responsive layout with Bootstrap
- Hero banner with overlay for readable text
- Destination cards with image cropping and hover lift
- Simple, semantic HTML structure ready to be connected to a backend


## Where to look

- `index.html` — main layout and sections (hero, destinations, tours, contact)
- `style.css` — main styling and custom tweaks
- `images/` — hero and destination images

## Contributing

This project is intentionally simple. Contributions are welcome:

- Create an issue for larger changes or feature requests.
- Fork the repo, make changes, and open a pull request.
- Keep changes focused and add brief notes explaining intent.

## License

Feel free to adapt this code for personal or educational use. Add a license file if you plan to publish commercially.

## Contact

Built with a love of travel and clean design. If you want help expanding this into a full product (backend, booking flows, payments), tell me what you need and I can help sketch it out.

Happy travels ✈️
